The potential candidate must have a strong engineering and technical background, especially in the field of machine learning, with at least 4 years programming expertise. The potential candidate will be required to develop code for models that will be applied to problems in the field of quantum computation. The potential candidate is also encouraged to learn and understand enough quantum computation literature to run experiments in simulation and on quantum computing hardware.

Strong communication and interpersonal skills are required, along with the ability to work in a dynamic, product oriented, global team. GPU computing is the most productive and pervasive platform for deep learning and AI. We integrate and optimize every deep learning framework. We work with most major technology providers and support a broad range of Fortune 500 companies in their machine and deep learning needs. With deep learning, we can teach AI to do almost anything. New internet services, like Google Assistant, have learned speech from sound and provide a more natural way to access information. Self-driving cars use deep learning to recognize the space the car inhabits, the lanes in which it drives, and the objects to avoid. In healthcare, neural networks trained with millions of medical images can find clues in MRIs that until now could only be found through invasive biopsies. In recommendation systems, we learn how to understand users' desires and serve them what they truly are looking for. AI will spur a wave of social progress unmatched since the industrial revolution.
